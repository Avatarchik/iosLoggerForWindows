# iosLoggerForWindows

This is iOS system log viewer windows. 
The execution file is contained as well for fast execution.

This project is in early stage of development. 

I am using c# as framing the UI and parsing the log.

I am also using the libmobiledevice library for getting syslog line by line.

Execution included at iosLoggerForWindows/IosSysLogger/bin/Debug iOSsyslogger.exe (All of the dll and exe files must be included with it to be run correctly)
